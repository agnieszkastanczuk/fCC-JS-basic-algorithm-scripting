# freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting

[freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scriptinge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) consists of 16 small tasks of varying degrees of complexity, from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays. 

This repository contains my solutions. I learned JavaScript and tried to create the correct and most optimal code.
