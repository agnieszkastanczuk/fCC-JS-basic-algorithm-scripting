# freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting

[freeCodeCamp - Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) is an excerpt from the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course" by freeCodeCamp. It consists of 16 small tasks of varying degrees of complexity, from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays. 

This repository contains my solutions. I learned JavaScript and tried to create the correct and most optimal code.
